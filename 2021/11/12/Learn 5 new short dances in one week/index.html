However, not everyone can take hobbies as a career due to various objective obstructions. My hobby was dancing and I want to bring it back into my life by taking the challenge of ‘Learn 5 new short dances in one week’. If you enjoy dancing as I do or feel sorry for giving up your hobbies, I hope this blog can inspire and motivate you to stick to whatever you were passionate about.</p>
<p>To get on our path, I think the most important thing is to have clear motivation, such as a goal, faith, or simply to beat ourselves. Once having recognized the problem, we can find motivation internally and externally. From my personal experience, though I have been dancing for 14 years, I quit training for almost 5 years and I was not sure if I can still dance well. Witnessing my mom dancing on the square with her friends recalled my memory of the days in the dance studio. Feeling happiness for the past and regret for the present, I started my challenge. Outside stimuli such as social media, friends and families can be the catalyst of our behavior, and reviewing long term episodic memories, which contain primarily sensory such as visual images, sounds, etc. can strengthen our belief in action. The first day of my challenge was spent on enhancing motivation and making goals.</p>
<p>Once we have clear motivation, the second step is to set a measurable goal in case we’re all talking and no action. You can start with having a time-limit challenge as I did. However, my experience of completing the challenge was not as easy as I expected. Although I love dancing, sometimes I was too lazy to keep on regular training. In order to avoid this situation, I break my challenge down into each day and monitor myself by using the theory of avoidance and avoidance conflict. For example, when I was taking the physical training class of Jazz, I would monitor myself by telling my friends that “If I can’t stick to this set of push-ups, I’ll do 15 more when I get home.” I don’t want to do another 15 push-ups and embarrass myself, thus I have to stick on! In this way, I achieved the ultimate.</p>
<p>After having strong motivation and clear goals, we need to search for information and evaluate the best way to accomplish it. In fact, I spent the first three days figuring out the right way to complete the challenge. On the second day, I tried to learn dancing alone at home. However, the small mirror in my house and my roommate’s complaints about the stereo made it almost impossible for me to complete my daily goals. Therefore, I chose a dance studio according to the recommendation list of Meituan the next day and it really felt better to practice in a studio with some people who shared my interests and I even made friends in the following days. I recommend readers develop hobbies with friends, too. One reason is that arrangements with friends can motivate and supervise us to stick on. Another is that we usually unconsciously adapt to the collective and become conformity thus a loving community will finally be built. Being exposed to such an environment, I became conformist as I worshipped the same dancers, bought the same shoes for dancing and drank the same beverages as my friends. In fact, every time I conform to the herd effect, my brain seems to give me positive rewards, and I love the feeling of community because learning with my peers has fulfilled my need of belongingness and changed my life. In addition, I have visited several dance studios during my challenge and purchased lessons from one of them. More on how to choose a good dance studio will be posted later.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is important to keep enthusiastic about our hobbies. In order to do this, I advise readers to seek out positive stimuli that are suitable for yourselves. Especially those that are new and exciting, just in case of habituation. As for me, after getting bored imitating a dancing influencer on TikTok, I turned my attention to a variety show named Born to Dance, which is pretty much like ‘So You Think You Can Dance’. Every week, the different dance performances in the variety show always impress me and inspire me to dream of dancing like that one day. By being exposed to this stimulus at intervals, I can always find new charm of dance. </p>
<p>Having a hobby is like choosing a lifestyle. I sincerely hope my readers can keep a hobby that will help you relax from a daily life. We will always keep doing what we love! </p>
